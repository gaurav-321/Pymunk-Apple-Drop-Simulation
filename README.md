# 🍎 Pymunk-Apple-Drop-Simulation

✨ **Description**  
Pymunk-Apple-Drop-Simulation is a simple 2D physics simulation that demonstrates how an apple falls and bounces off a static platform using Pygame for graphics and Pymunk for physics. This project is perfect for beginners learning about game development and 2D physics simulations.

🚀 **Features**
- **Realistic Physics**: Simulates gravity, collision detection, and bouncing.
- **User Interaction**: Press 'w' to give the apple an upward impulse.
- **Simple GUI**: Uses Pygame to create a window with clear visuals.

🛠️ **Installation**  
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you will need to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pygame pymunk
```

📦 **Usage**  
Here’s how you can use the program:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pygame
import pymunk
import pymunk.pygame_util

# Initialize Pygame and Pymunk
pygame.init()
space = pymunk.Space()
draw_options = pymunk.pygame_util.DrawOptions(screen)

# Create and run the simulation loop
simulation_loop(space, draw_options)
```

🔧 **Configuration**  
No additional configuration is required. The script initializes everything automatically.

🧪 **Tests**  
Tests are not available for this project as it's a simple simulation with minimal complexity.
