# üçé Pymunk-Apple-Drop-Simulation

## Description

Pymunk-Apple-Drop-Simulation is a simple 2D physics simulation that demonstrates how an apple falls and bounces off a static platform using Pygame for graphics and Pymunk for physics. This project is perfect for beginners learning about game development and 2D physics simulations.

## Features
- **Realistic Physics**: Simulates gravity, collision detection, and bouncing.
- **User Interaction**: Press 'w' to give the apple an upward impulse.
- **Simple GUI**: Uses Pygame to create a window with clear visuals.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you will need to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pygame pymunk
```

## Usage

Here‚Äôs how you can use the program:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pygame
import pymunk
import pymunk.pygame_util

# Initialize Pygame and Pymunk
pygame.init()
space = pymunk.Space()
draw_options = pymunk.pygame_util.DrawOptions(screen)

# Create and run the simulation loop
simulation_loop(space, draw_options)
```

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The script initializes everything automatically.

## Tests

Tests are not available for this project as it's a simple simulation with minimal complexity.
