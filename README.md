# Pymunk Apple Drop Simulation
This is a simple simulation made using Pygame and Pymunk in Python. It displays an apple and a static platform on the screen. The apple falls due to gravity and bounces off the platform. The user can press the w key to give the apple an upward impulse.

## Requirements
To run this simulation, you will need to have the following packages installed:

- Pygame
- Pymunk
You can install these packages using pip:
```
pip install pygame
pip install pymunk
```
## Running the simulation
To run the simulation, clone this repository and navigate to the directory in your terminal. Then, run the following command:

```
python apple_drop.py
```
The simulation window will open and you can press the w key to give the apple an upward impulse. The simulation will run until you close the window.
